# Physics-Zombie-Game
The first 3D game I attempted in Unity. It was the precursor to the [Respite Project](https://github.com/Sove67/Respite), and is no longer an active project of mine.

## Features
- A procedural city generator
- A third person player character
- Implementation of Craig Reynolds' Boid system to control Zombie AI
